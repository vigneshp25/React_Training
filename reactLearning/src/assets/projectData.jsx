          Quickly.App is a cloud-based, low-code application development
          platform that accelerates enterprise software delivery by enabling
          developers and business users to build scalable web and mobile
          applications through drag-and-drop builders, workflow automation, and
          reusable components. In this project, I developed reusable,
          high-performance UI components using React.js with Hooks and Context
          API to improve maintainability and scalability, while integrating them
          with REST APIs to support dynamic, real-time data exchange. I
          translated Figma mockups into pixel-perfect, responsive interfaces
          using Tailwind CSS and SCSS, and optimized performance with techniques
          such as code splitting, memoization, and lazy loading to significantly
          reduce load times. Additionally, I collaborated closely with
          designers, product managers, and backend developers as part of a
          60-member agile team, ensuring smooth delivery of high-quality,
          user-centric features.
