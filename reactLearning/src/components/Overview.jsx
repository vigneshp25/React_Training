                Hi there! My name is Vigneshwaran, and I specialize in web development and UI design. With over 10 years and
                9 months of experience, I have honed my skills as a UI developer. I have strong expertise in HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript, along with proficiency in design tools such as Adobe XD and Figma. Currently, I serve as a Senior
                Associate Developer at Boston Harbor Consulting.

                Throughout my career, I've worked extensively with various UI technologies, including SAP CPQ UI customization,
                Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), TeamSite, and frameworks/libraries like Angular and React. I also have a
                solid understanding of Figma-based design workflows.
